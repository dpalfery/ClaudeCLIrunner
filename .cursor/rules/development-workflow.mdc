# Development Workflow

## Pull Request Guidelines
- Target the develop branch by default
- Use descriptive PR titles and summaries
- Reference related issues with #issue-number
- Every PR must include:
  - Summary of changes
  - Unit/integration tests for new/updated features
  - Updates to documentation (if API surface changes)
- Ensure build passes and tests succeed before review

## Dependency Management
- Use NuGet for all dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Avoid unnecessary packages
- All new dependencies must be reviewed

## Documentation Requirements
- Keep [README.md](mdc:README.md) up to date
- All public APIs must include XML doc comments
- Add/Update OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for endpoints

## Getting Started
1. Clone repository
2. Copy `appsettings.json.template` to `appsettings.json`
3. Set required environment variables
4. Run `dotnet build`
5. Run `dotnet test` to verify setup

## Known Limitations
- Some legacy modules may not conform to latest architecture
- Multi-tenancy and distributed transactions not fully implemented
