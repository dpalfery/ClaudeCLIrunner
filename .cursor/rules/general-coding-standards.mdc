- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow consistent naming conventions

## Error Handling
- Always handle exceptions appropriately
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors for debugging purposes
- Don't suppress or ignore exceptions

## Code Organization
- Use clear and descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables
- Keep methods focused on a single responsibility
- Organize code into logical namespaces and folders
- Remove unused code and imports

## Documentation
- Write clear comments for complex logic
- Document public APIs and interfaces
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Use XML documentation comments in C#

## Testing
- Write unit tests for critical functionality
- Use meaningful test names that describe the scenario
- Follow arrange-act-assert pattern
- Test both success and failure cases

## Version Control
- Make atomic commits with clear messages
- Don't commit sensitive information
- Use meaningful branch names
- Keep commit history clean and readable
